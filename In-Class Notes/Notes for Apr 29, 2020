In-Class Notes for April 29, 2020
---------------------------------

We are doing a bottom up program? I wasn't really listening only just somewhat chimed in. From what I can gather we are 
building classes before making the parent class. A generic class.

Circle: 
Data: 
    radius          - double
    PI              - const float
    positionX       - double
    positionY       - double
    isVisible       - bool
    color           - int
    border          - double (if 0 then no border)
    borderColor     - int
    borderOpacity   - double
    borderPattern   - ?
    fillPattern     - ?
Methods Names:
    radius          -> resize, rescale
    PI              -> ?
    positionX       -> position, doMove
    positionY       -> position, doMove
    isVisible       -> isVisible
    color           -> setColor
    border          -> hasBorder
    borderColor     -> setBorderColor
    borderOpacity   -> setBorderOpacity
    borderPattern   -> setBorderPattern
    fillPattern     -> fillPattern
    
These are just some data that we might need within a circle class.
Ah, we are looking at OO programming. He said, the way you should write your code should be readable and understandable
without looking at documentation. The point here is that OOP is centered around Object Oriented Design. He want's us
to understand classes and really look in to how classes are structured.

Next week, polymorphism
