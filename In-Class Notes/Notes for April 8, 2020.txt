In-Class Notes for April 8, 2020
--------------------------------

Project 2 Overview and Questions:
We are still using the struct record but the record isn't a class. Rather the linked list is going to be the class. 

    p = new double[1]; // same as new double;
    delete p;
    
    p = new double[2];
    delete [] p;
    
These are just some cases that you'll have to do when freeing up memory. Don't need to use the bracket with an array of
one but will have to if the array is two or more. Much like Java without the constructor, C++ can do the same as well. 
However, probably should write it in. 

    if (debugMode) // This is the code for the C program
    {
        printf("...");
    }
    
    #ifdef DEBUGMODE // This will be the C++ version
        printf("...");
    #endif
    
Wherever we had the C version, replace with the #ifdef. In order to show the debugmode you'll have to use the -D option
as shown below.

    g++ -D DEBUGMODE ...
    
If we want to run the program with debugmode on, add #define above the #ifdef and comment it out when compiling the finished
version. But for our project, do it twice so one can have the debug mode and one can have the commented #define.

Just took Quiz 7. monkaS.
