# Listing Factors in C++

Redo the assignment from Homework 1 in C++. Replace all C input/output statements with C++ statements. (```cin, cout, cin.getline```) to get the same formatted output as Homework1.    

## Instructions:    
1. Do not use the header file ```stdio.h``` (you cannot use ```cstdio```, either).
    - Instead, use ```iostream```.
2. Re-make the ```convert``` function by the following prototype:
    ```c++
    void convertc(double, double &)
    ```
3. Compile your code using ```g++``` command on the schools unix system using the required compilation options described on the course main page.
