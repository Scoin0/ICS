# Homework2b Assignment

## Instructions:    
Write a function, ```halfstring```, which creates a new string which skips every other letter.    
For example:
   - "John Smith" gives "Jh mt"
    
1. ```halfstring.c``` and ```halfstring.h```
   - The function prototype must be:
   ```c
   void halfstring(const char [ ], char [ ]);
   ```
   - As a result, you will have both the resulted string and the original one.    
   - Do not user ANY system-defined string functions (Those found in ```string.h```)
2. ```driver.c```
   - Write driver code to test the function.     
   - Your program and output must be self-explanatory; the output must explain about what it is doing, what the input is, what the expected output is, and what the actual result is.       
3. Testing
   - Provide a scripted file using the ```script``` command with at least 3 resonable results.

## Comments after submission:
```    
   - Proof.txt: You should compile .c files separately.    
   - Testing: Empty string?
   - Coding Style: Comments for main. The halfstring does not place a null character at the end.
```
